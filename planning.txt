High-Level Plan:
- Get cat photo data from API
- Pre-process photos
	- Turn to all black-and-white
	- 'Un-roll' into vectors of pixels
- Run model


API Notes:
1) The Cat API - http://thecatapi.com/ - has XML limitation, but unlimited requests with token
2) Rescue Groups - https://www.rescuegroups.org/services/adoptable-pet-data-api/ - has JSON format, but might have other limitations
3) What Cat API - takes request of photo and spits back out possible breeds/probabilities. Not useful here, but might be fuel for future projects...
